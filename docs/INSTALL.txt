Installation
------------

To enable this product in a buildout-based installation:

1. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``collective.prettydate`` to the list of
   eggs to install ::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        collective.prettydate

2. You may need to extend a five.grok known good set (KGS) to make sure that
   you get the right versions of the packages that make up five.grok ::

    [buildout]
    ...
    extends =
        http://good-py.appspot.com/release/five.grok/1.2.0-1?plone=4.1

After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will
take care of updating your system.
