Installation
------------

To enable this product in a buildout-based installation:

1. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``collective.prettydate`` to the list of
   eggs to install ::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        collective.prettydate

After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will
take care of updating your system.
